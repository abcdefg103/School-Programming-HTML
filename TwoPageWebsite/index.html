                        are an essential part of any major family food times, and a standard for restaurants. 
                        Plates are regarded as a sophisticated method of consuming food. 
                        It keeps the germs from the cold ground. Many people in the world 
                        put their food on a plate before consumption. 
                        It also helped many dishwasher companies grow. 
                        As the image shows, it is a flat disk-like object. 
                        It is very delicate, and can easily crack 
                        at a blink of an eye if not cared for properly. 
                        Although not a proper way of use, It has also been 
                        used often for decorative purposes, where people will 
                        put drawings on it and sell for high prices. I personally favor this dinner essential because
                        I could eat it with many other foods, and I find myself using it over and over again.
