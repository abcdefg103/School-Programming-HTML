                        which is a trident like object 3-4 prongs that is used for grabbing onto food. 
                        You would use it by stabbing it onto the food of your choice, 
                        and then lifting it up. If done right, the food should lift up 
                        along with the fork. Its existence goes way back in history. 
                        Although the existence of it debatably dates back to 4000 years
                        ago, some say that it was invented only about 1500 years ago.
                        It was not used in America until the American Revolution. <br><br> Pokey poke poke go food yum yum</td>

                        Spoon is a common object that is so widely used that, even you may have heard of. 
                        It is a stick with a half-spherical empty dome attached to it. 
                        It commonly goes along with fork as the 2 standards of silverware.
                        Another form of spoons date back to Ancient Egypt. 
                        Spoons are considered to be a clean, sophisticated and healthy way to 
                        eat various soup and rice. If cared for, it will keep out all types of germs. 
                        It was used by kids, teens, young adults, adults, mothers, fathers, grandparents, elders, 
                        people from age 1-&#8734 and more people. So if you haven't been using spoons, you better now. <br><br> Spoons are good, they're big and small, just don't use them on meats and stuff. </td>

                        Chopsticks are one of the rarer silverwares in the area of usage unless if you are an asian. It is basically 2 long sticks, 
                        but learning how to use them is harder. Even I took 10 years to learn how to use it. But if you do 
                        know how to use it, it does help you a lot in life. it helps you grab onto delicate food that forks
                        will not work on, and it will be easier to handle, because it doesn't instigate the fear that it will
                        poke you hard when dropped. But be warned: Chopsticks are faulty in the fact that food can easily fall
                        out. <br><br> Hard to use, hard to find. It wont hurt you a lot if you didn't even know it existed.</td>

                        Splayds are the best thing to exist in this world. It takes the purpose of spoon, fork and knife. 
                        Spoons and forks I have explained before, but knives, I have not. Knifes are dangerous objects that 
                        can slice through many things, and even you. Butter knives aren't as dangerous as knives, but it can 
                        still hurt you. Be careful around them. Anyways, for a splayd to contain all three, it is the best 
                        utensil and silverware ever. <br><br> You're supposed to grab it by the blade, because the blade is the handle. So wouldn't that mean your hand is in danger of being hurt?</td>
