            <tr><td><br>In College, Gladys West earned a masters degree in mathematics and graduated college in 1955.
            She was hired by the U.S. Naval Proving Ground, and was applauded for her excelent skills of solving
             complex math problems by hand. She made a calculator that found the movement of Pluto in relation to Neptune.
             <br><br>
             She contributed to making Seasat and GEOSAT, which collects data on the ocean and modelling earth by computer respectively.
             With her team, she also made a program that calculated the orbits of satalites. With all these calculations, they could 
             finally make a geoid, a complete model of the earth. It is also a basis of GPS.
             She retired from the U.S. Naval Proving Ground, and earned a Ph.D. in Public Administration.</td>
